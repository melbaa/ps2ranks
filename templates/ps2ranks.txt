        <p />
        The numbers are rating and rating deviation respectively.
        <p />
        A higher rating represents higher skill. Killing low rated
        players over and over won't improve the rating for example. Killing
        players of relatively equal or greater skill improves rating.
        <p />        
        The rating deviation, RD, together with the rating represent the interval
        where the true skill of the player is. For example 
        for a player with rating 1800 and RD of 100, we can be 95%
        confident that his real strength is in the interval from 1600 to 2000.
        <p />
        We want RD to be small in order to be more specific, but at the same 
        time we want it to be large enough, so that ratings converge fast to
        values close to the true skill of the player.
        <p />
        Rank and rating are different. Rank is simply the number of players
        that have a better rating than the player being ranked.

        <h2> Questions And Answers</h2>
        
        <h3>The list of top players is full of hackers and stat padders.
        It should be easy to filter them, why don't you do it?</h3>
          Every system can be gamed and I won't play internet police. I want you 
          to realize that those players are a minority and their effect on the
          overall rankings is insignificant. I'll add some details that should
          make them stand out more (battle rank, minutes played). You are 
          encouraged to report cheaters to Sony, because usually the means to 
          cheat this leaderboard require you to break ingame rules and what
          Sony calls "the spirit of the Game". Check out their 
          <a href="https://www.planetside2.com/eula">EULA</a> and 
          <a href="https://www.soe.com/termsofservice.vm">Terms of Service</a>.
          Also get in contact with the ingame admins when they announce
          their presence. 
        
        
        <h3>Why make this leaderboard?</h3>
          I've had it in mind ever since I started playing, which was as soon as 
          the game had its official release. I took the chance to learn a few 
          things and while I was sceptical at first, the results satisfy me, so
          I decided to publish them. Please don't take any numbers too seriously,
          there are many ways to play the game. Raising your rating by 100 
          points probably isn't worth the pain you may have to endure.
          
        <h3>What about adding feature X?</h3>
          I won't go into detail what will and won't be implemented, as it
          may change at any time. If I add something interesting, I'll 
          announce it in the planetside reddit - /r/planetside. 
          
        <h3>How can it be possible to accurately rank people against each 
        other across servers? Seeing as they will never fight each other.
         - ultimatox on reddit</h3>
          While some players have multiple characters on different servers, 
          the majority of the players will never meet. Many won't meet even 
          when they play on the same server. We'll have to trust some factors 
          that are out of our hands on this one. SOE is balancing the 
          populations on the servers by rotating the recommended severs from 
          time to time. This should in theory make the skill averages of the 
          different servers the same. Another point is that players keep 
          correcting their play style from feedback that comes from a variety 
          of shared sources (reddit, forums, patch notes, ranklists), not 
          just ingame. 
          
        <h3>Can you really evaluate player skill simply by kills? The top 
        rated on your list will -always- be MAX/vehicle farmers. Or, for 
        example, the guy who's currently ranked #2 who has over a third of 
        his kills from AI mines. - Sattorin on reddit</h3>
          Some play styles are more rewarding than others. The top players 
          will use whatever gives them the most advantage. To compete with 
          them you will have to challenge them directly (or players in the 
          same rating range). How you do that is up to you. It can be with 
          vehicles or a group of 3 friends with decimators. You could 
          try to replicate their strategy if it seems so easy.

        <h3>Is the only thing determining 
        skill on this list a players ability to find and kill other players 
        of higher skill on this list? How did you then initially determine 
        rankings? Its a cool idea but seems rather arbitrary. - Phrygen on reddit</h3>
          All kills award rating, but if your opponent's rating is low 
          compared to yours (think for example 200 points difference) you 
          will win a point or even just a fraction of a point. Your opponent 
          won't lose much rating either, because as far as the model is 
          concerned, everything worked out as expected. The better player 
          won. If however the low ranked player wins, his prize will be much 
          bigger and the penalty for the high ranked player will be much bigger.
          
        
        <h3>How are you rating players?</h3>
          I'm using the glicko-2 rating system, which is self correcting. 
          New players start out with 
          1500 rating and 100 rating deviation. The relatively high rating deviation 
          allows them to move fast up or down the ladder for a while. Soon enough
          they find a spot where they perform consistently and the deviation
          starts to drop.

      <div id="thoughts">
        <h2> Analysis And Thoughts </h2>
        
        <h3> On Inflation </h3>
        There is ratings inflation among the highest rated players. It was
        expected, it's hard to rate accurately players that never lose. 
        The model correctly places those players above everyone else, so I'm
        still happy. Ratings can't grow indefinetely by killing a lower rated
        player, so it's interesting to see where the roof is. 
        
        <h3> On Inactive Players </h3>
        Inactive players can be dealt with in many ways, but all have 
        disadvantages. Most implementations assign an inactive player a 
        provisional status and he's excluded from ranklists. I decided to
        delete them instead. It's easy to get your rating back, because as soon
        you come back, you will get ranked again. There's no need to grind or
        invest a lot of time, it's enough to win against some strong players.
        This loses us historical
        achievments, but they aren't too meaningful, because the game,
        the player base and 
        ratings are always moving. Comparing a current rating with one from 
        the past will be nothing but misleading. 
        
        <h3> On Infantry Against Vehicles </h3>
        I've never considered making separate lists for vehicle-only or 
        knife-only players. I wanted to create an overview, a summary of the
        playerbase, not an in-depth analysis. I expected the top players to be
        vehicle-only, the game was designed that way. It seems this is slowly
        changing in favor of infantry players. 
        
        <h3> On Interpretation Of The Data </h3>
        A player can't be summarized by a few numbers, I'm not pretending
        to have achieved such a thing. Use the data to help you make up your
        mind about a player. A person is multidimensional, some are
        better at aim, others at strategy and patience, 
        others at teamplay, others at trashtalking and drama. Sadly the SOE
        census doesn't show that much. Hopefully in the future teams (squads,
        platoons, alliances of the people shooting eachother) will
        appear in the census and someone will make yet another ranklist. 
        Support players are not accurately represented at all. This includes
        squad/platoon leaders, people that play for objectives (generators,
        capturing bases), medics, drivers and pilots that give all shots to
        their gunners, people with playstyles that generate them only assists.
        Even if events from those players were available in the census, I
        can't imagine incorporating them in a way that makes sense. It would be
        easy to create separate leaderboards for support players, 
        but that won't clarify
        how they fit in the grand scheme of things. Maybe someone will find a
        way. I hope I've set some foundation that will inspire others. 
        
        <h3> On Rating Medics </h3>
        Note this isn't implemented, it's just a mental exercise. 
        What does it mean to ressurect a player? Killing someone makes your
        team stronger because there's one less opponent and because you gained
        some XP. Ressurecting someone makes your team stronger because there's
        one more ally and because you gained some XP. It doesn't take away the
        XP from the killer. So at first glance
        they are pretty much the same, at least for the guy doing the 
        killng/ressurecting. Who to penalize and who to reward? I'd do it like this:
        a player gets killed, which awards rating to the killer and penalizes
        the guy that died. A medic comes and resurrects, this reverts the 
        previous change in ratings and instead awards the medic and penalizes
        the killer. The guy that died gets away with no rating loss, no XP. The medic
        wins rating and XP, the killer loses rating and wins XP, he got outplayed
        by a medic, because he gave away his position, lost ammo, lost grenades,
        lost health and shields, lost potential. But what if the resurrected guy
        gets killed again? Should the medic keep his rating reward? Probably not, 
        they still get away with XP. 
        
        <h3> On Things That Oneshot Infantry, Past And Present </h3>
        I love that, so I had to mention it. Never forget. 
        Might be interesting to newer players.
